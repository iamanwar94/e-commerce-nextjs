        We accept Visa®, MasterCard®, American Express® and Discover® credit

      <h4 style={{ textAlign: "start", marginTop: "20px" }}>Sales Tax</h4>
      <p>
        All merchandise purchases are subject to sales tax in accordance with
        the current state and local tax rates for the shipping/delivery
        destination. Estimated Sales Tax is calculated at the time of purchase
        and is generally based on the total selling price of each item, which,
        depending on local and state laws, may include discounts and shipping
        and processing charges. To the extent any of the factors affecting the
        calculation of sales tax change between the time you place an order and
        the time your credit card is charged, the amount appearing on your order
        as Estimated Tax may differ from the sales taxes ultimately charged.

        Delivery Methods
      </h4>
      <p>
        The size and weight of your online purchase are factors that help us
        determine the most efficient delivery method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Standard Shipping– We ship smaller, lighter items via courier or mail
        (e.g. UPS or Fed Ex). Items may require assembly. You’ll receive
        notification as soon as the order ships. Available shipping options will
        be noted in the shopping cart, but generally include 1-day and 2-day
        shipping. If 1-day shipping is available for an order, the order is
        expected to be delivered within 1 business day after it has been shipped
        and picked up by the delivery carrier. If 2-day shipping is available
        for an order, the order is expected to be delivered within 2 business
        days after it has been shipped and picked up by the delivery carrier.
        Business days do not include weekends. Delivery may be delayed by
        factors such as changes in inventory, delivery capacity, and unforeseen
        circumstances beyond our control, such as strikes, natural disasters,
        and inclement weather. Please read our Shipping and Delivery policy for
        more information.

        destination) or via our Ashcomm LLC shipping service: Premium Delivery
        service, which includes furniture assembly, furniture set up in your
        room of choice, and removal of all packaging materials, or Threshold
        Delivery service, which places your furniture, in its original

        hours prior to delivery, or if no one is home when the delivery team
        arrives. If delivery does not take place within 30 days of the original
        scheduled delivery date, the order may be treated as a canceled order.
